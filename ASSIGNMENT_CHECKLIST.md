## What's Left (Manual Steps)

### STEP 1: Find S3 Bucket Name
**How to find**:
1. Log in to AWS Console
2. Go to Elastic Beanstalk
3. Click on "mysite-app"
4. Click "Application versions"
5. Look at the S3 bucket column - it will be something like:
   - `elasticbeanstalk-us-east-1-123456789012`
6. Update `.travis.yml` line 35 with this bucket name

**Or check S3 directly**:
1. Go to S3 in AWS Console
2. Look for bucket starting with `elasticbeanstalk-us-east-1-`

---

### STEP 2: Get AWS Access Keys
**How to get**:
1. Log in to AWS Console
2. Click your username (top right) → "Security credentials"
3. Scroll to "Access keys"
4. Click "Create access key"
5. Choose "Command Line Interface (CLI)"
6. Check acknowledgment box
7. Click "Create access key"
8. **IMPORTANT**: Copy both:
   - Access Key ID
   - Secret Access Key
   - Save them immediately - you won't see the secret again!

---

### STEP 3: Add AWS Credentials to Travis CI
**How to add**:
1. Go to: https://travis-ci.com/github/itsSirish/swe1-app
2. Click "More options" (three dots) → "Settings"
3. Scroll to "Environment Variables"
4. Add first variable:
   - Name: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - Value: [paste your access key ID]
   - Branch: All branches
   - **IMPORTANT**: Keep "Display value in build log" OFF
   - Click "Add"
5. Add second variable:
   - Name: `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
   - Value: [paste your secret access key]
   - Branch: All branches
   - **IMPORTANT**: Keep "Display value in build log" OFF
   - Click "Add"

---

### STEP 4: Activate Repository in Travis CI
1. Go to: https://travis-ci.com/
2. Click your profile picture → "Settings"
3. Find "itsSirish/swe1-app"
4. Toggle switch to ON (green)
5. If you don't see it, click "Sync account"

---

### STEP 5: Activate Repository in Coveralls
1. Go to: https://coveralls.io/
2. Click "Add repos"
3. Find "itsSirish/swe1-app"
4. Toggle switch to ON
5. (Optional) Copy repo token if builds fail

---

### STEP 6: Test Code Quality Locally (Optional but Recommended)
Run these commands to ensure everything passes before pushing:

```bash
# Format code with black
black .

# Check formatting
black --check .

# Check linting
flake8 .

# Run tests
python manage.py test

# Run tests with coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
```

---

### STEP 7: Commit and Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Travis CI configuration with all assignment requirements

- Configure Travis CI for automated builds
- Add Black code formatting checks
- Add Flake8 linting
- Add coverage.py and Coveralls integration
- Configure AWS EB deployment
- Add README with badges
- Add basic test suite"

git push origin main
```

---

### STEP 8: Watch First Build
1. Go to: https://travis-ci.com/github/itsSirish/swe1-app
2. You should see a build start automatically
3. Click on the build to watch the log
4. It should:
   - Install dependencies ✓
   - Run migrations ✓
   - Check black formatting ✓
   - Check flake8 linting ✓
   - Run tests ✓
   - Report coverage to coveralls ✓
   - Deploy to AWS EB ✓

---

### STEP 9: Enable Branch Protection
1. Go to: https://github.com/itsSirish/swe1-app/settings/branches
2. Click "Add rule"
3. Branch name pattern: `main`
4. Check these boxes:
   - ☑ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ☑ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ☑ continuous-integration/travis-ci (select from list)
5. (Optional) Check:
   - ☑ Require a pull request before merging
6. Click "Create" or "Save changes"

---

### STEP 10: Test with Pull Request
1. Create test branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test-travis-ci
   ```

2. Make a small change (e.g., add comment to polls/views.py):
   ```bash
   echo "# Test comment" >> polls/views.py
   git add polls/views.py
   git commit -m "Test Travis CI on PR"
   git push origin test-travis-ci
   ```

3. Go to GitHub and create Pull Request from `test-travis-ci` to `main`

4. You should see:
   - Travis CI check appears
   - Shows as "pending" while running
   - Shows "passed" (green checkmark) or "failed" (red X)
   - Cannot merge until checks pass (if branch protection enabled)

---

## Definition of DONE Verification

Per the assignment, "As a TA I know that this is DONE when":

### ✅ 1. "I open a PR against your repo and I see the Travis CI PR build start"
**Implementation**:
- Travis configured to run on all branches (not just main)
- Pull requests automatically trigger builds
- Status check appears on PR page

**Verification**: Create PR and see Travis CI check

---

### ✅ 2. "If there are any flake8 violations or black formatter issues Travis will mark this build red meaning the build 'failed'"
**Implementation**:
- `.travis.yml` line 16: `black --check .` (fails if formatting issues)
- `.travis.yml` line 19: `flake8 .` (fails if linting issues)
- Both run before tests
- Build stops if either fails

**Verification**: Intentionally add poorly formatted code and watch build fail

---

### ✅ 3. "The app gets successfully deployed to EB upon successful completion of the tests"
**Implementation**:
- `.travis.yml` lines 29-40: Deploy section
- Only deploys if all tests pass (after_success)
- Only deploys on main branch
- Uses AWS credentials from environment variables

**Verification**: Push to main, watch build pass, check EB environment updates

---
